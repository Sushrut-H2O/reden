# Reden 

Reden (the German verb for "talking") is the next great messaging app! Maybe...

To run the project, run `npm install` and then `npm run server` in the root directory, and in another terminal run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`.
The project can be seen on "http://localhost:8000".

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project!
